					I know of places, actions, and things.  Most of my vocabulary describes places and is used

					south, up, or down.  I know about a few special objects, like a black rod hidden in the cave.	These 
					objects can be manipulated using some of the action words that I know.	 Usually you will need to 
					give both the object and action words (in either order), but sometimes I can infer the object from 
					the verb alone.  The objects have side effects; for 
					instance, the rod scares the bird.	 Usually people having trouble moving just need to try a few more 
					words.	 Usually people trying unsuccessfully to manipulate an object are attempting something beyond 
					their (or my!) capabilities and should try a completely different tack.  To speed the game you can 
					sometimes move long distances with a single word.	For example, \"building\" usually gets you to the 
					building from anywhere bove ground except when lost in the forest.	 Also, note that cave passages 
					turn a lot, and that leaving a room to the north does not guarantee entering the next from the south.
