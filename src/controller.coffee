# # MITHGrid Controllers
#
# Controllers translate UI events into MITHGrid events. The goal is to create programs that only need a different set of
# controllers to allow a different manner of user interaction.
#
MITHGrid.namespace 'Controller', (Controller) ->
	# ## Controller
	#
	# Controllers do not have any display component, so they only need a class name and the configuration object.
	# Controller objects use the #bind() method to bind a controller to a UI element. The returned object is used to
	# manage that particular binding.
	#
	# Options:
	#
	# * **bind** - configuration options passed to the binding object constructor
	#
	# * **selectors** - a map of strings to CSS selectors for finding children of a UI element when binding
	#

			#
			# We need something that can have functions bindable to an element
			# this isn't that object, but can produce that object, so this is a kind of controller factory
			# that can be used by lenses
			#
			# ### #initBind
			#
			# Initialize the binding for the given element. If the element is a string or an object without
			# a .node property, then the element is assumed to be a DOM element. Otherwise, it is assumed to be
			# a Raphaël node.
			#
			# FIXME: This overloading should be two different classes. We should move the Raphaël code out of here
			# since this is the only piece of MITHGrid that understands anything about Raphaël. It's reasonable that
			# a developer know if they're dealing with a regular DOM element or a Raphaël node.
			#
			# Parameters:
			#
			# * element - the DOM element being bound
			#
			# Returns:
			#
			# The initialized binding object.

			# ### #bind
			#
			# Binds the controller to the given UI element and returns an object that can be used to manage the
			# binding. This is the method that will be used most outside the controller definition.
			#
			# Bindings can have events associated with them depending on how the controller is configured.
			#
			# Parameters:
			#
			# * element - the DOM element (or Raphaël node) to which the controller should bind
			#
			# * args... - optional arguments to be passed to the #applyBindings() method
			#
			# Returns:
			#
			# The binding object used to manage the binding.

			# ### #applyBindings
			#
			# This method should be overridden in any subclass. The #bind() method will call this with the
			# new binding object and any arguments passed to the #bind() method.
			#
			# Parameters:
			#
			# * binding - the new binding object
			#
			# * args... - any additional arguments passed to the #bind() method after the element being bound
			#
			# Returns: Nothing.
			#
			that.applyBindings = (binding, args...) ->
			
			# ### #removeBindings
			#
			# This method should be overridden in any subclass. The #unbind() method on the binding object
			# will call this with the binding object and any arguments passed to the #bind() method.
			#
			# Parameters:
			#
			# * binding - the binding object
			#
			# * args... - any additional aguments passed to the #bind() method that returned the binding object
			#
			# Returns: Nothing.
