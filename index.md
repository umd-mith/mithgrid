### About MITHgrid


Here at MITH, we develop browser-based applications for many of our projects. We want these applications to share
components and allow extension through plugins, so we developed a framework for building data-centric, event-driven,
responsibility-oriented applications.

### Using MITHgrid

MITHgrid is available under the generous [3-clause BSD license](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause).
The easiest way to use MITHgrid is to sketch your application's data flow and then match up pieces with the various
component types available in MITHgrid.

### Contributing to MITHgrid

The easiest way to contribute to MITHgrid is to fork the github repository and create a pull request once you have 
implemented and tested your changes. We recommend that you join 
[the mith-dev Google group](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/mith-dev) and discuss proposed changes
to get feedback on their design and to make sure they fit in with the overall roadmap for MITHgrid.
