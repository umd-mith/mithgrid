<h3>About MITHgrid</h3>

<p>
	Here at MITH, we develop browser-based applications for many of our projects. We want these applications to share
	components and allow extension through plugins, so we developed a framework for building data-centric, event-driven,
	responsibility-oriented applications.
</p>

<h3>Using MITHgrid</h3>

<p>
	MITHgrid is available under the generous <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause">3-clause BSD license</a>.
	The easiest way to use MITHgrid is to sketch your application's data flow and then match up pieces with the various
	component types available in MITHgrid.
</p>

<h3>Contributing to MITHgrid</h3>

<p>
	The easiest way to contribute to MITHgrid is to fork the github repository and create a pull request once you have 
	implemented and tested your changes. We recommend that you join the mith-dev Google group and discuss proposed changes
	to get feedback on their design and to make sure they fit in with the overall roadmap for MITHgrid.
